        "summary": "These results are for the 0.5 hour extraction of HCl.\n\nSee also the metadata records for the 4 hour extraction of HCl, and the time trial data for 1 M HCl extractions.\n\nA regional survey of potential contaminants in marine or estuarine sediments is often one of the first steps in a post-disturbance environmental impact assessment. Of the many different chemical extraction or digestion procedures that have been proposed to quantify metal contamination, partial acid extractions are probably the best overall compromise between selectivity, sensitivity, precision, cost and expediency.  The extent to which measured metal concentrations relate to the anthropogenic fraction that is bioavailable is contentious, but is one of the desired outcomes of an assessment or prediction of biological impact.  As part of a regional survey of metal contamination associated with Australia's past waste management activities in Antarctica, we wanted to identify an acid type and extraction protocol that would allow a reasonable definition of the anthropogenic bioavailable fraction for a large number of samples.  From a kinetic study of the 1 M HCl extraction of two certified Certified Reference Materials (MESS-2 and PACS-2) and two Antarctic marine sediments, we concluded that a 4 hour extraction time allows the equilibrium dissolution of relatively labile metal contaminants, but does not favour the extraction of natural geogenic metals.  In a regional survey of 88 marine samples from the Casey Station area of East Antarctica, the 4 h extraction procedure correlated best with biological data, and most clearly identified those sediments thought to be contaminated by runoff from abandoned waste disposal sites.  Most importantly the 4 hour extraction provided better definition of the low to moderately contaminated locations by picking up small differences in anthropogenic metal concentrations.  For the purposes of inter-regional comparison, we recommend a 4 hour 1 M HCl acid extraction as a standard method for assessing metal contamination in Antarctica.\n\nThe fields in this dataset are\n\nLocation\nSite\nReplicate\nAntimony\nArsenic\nCadmium\nChromium\nCopper\nIron\nLead\nManganese\nNickel\nSilver\nTin\nZinc",

To develop improved methodologies for global land cover classifications as well as to provide global land cover products for immediate use in global change research, we have employed the NASA/NOAA Pathfinder Land (PAL) data set with a spatial resolution of 1km. This data set has a length of record of 14 years (1981-1994), providing the ability to test the stability of classification algorithms. Furthermore, this data set includes red, infrared, and thermal bands in addition to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of these additional bands improves discrimination between cover types. We aim through this study to 1) develop methodologies for global land cover classifications that are objective, reproducible, and feasible to implement on data from additional years and 2) produce a global land cover classification at 1 km spatial resolution accessible to the global change research community.",

This preenoil was then analysed for organochlorine pollutants like polychlorinated  biphenyls, (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDE and dieldrin. The species  under investigation were the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and the  Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides). The samples were collected from adult  breeding birds, and stored in -20 degrees C as soon as possible. The analysis  was done with relatively standard but very optimised methods, using a  gas-chromatograph and mass-selective detection.  \n\nData sheets:\nThe data are available in excel-sheets, located at Alterra, The Netherlands (the affiliation of the PI Nico van den Brink.). Data are available on PCB153 (polychlorinated biphenyl congener numbered 153), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDE (a metabolite of the pesticide DDT), and dieldrin (an insecticide).\n\nThe metadata are in 4 sheets (in meta data 2357.xls):\n1. 'Concentrations fulmars'\n2. 'Morphometric data fulmars'\n3. 'Concentrations Adelies'\n4. 'Morphometric data Adelies'\n\nThe column headings are: \n\n1. 'Concentrations fulmars'\n\n- Fulmar: bird number, corresponds with sheet 'morphometric data fulmars'.\n- PCB153: concentration of PCB-congener 153 (ng/g lipids)\n- HCB: concentration of hexachlorobenzene (ng/g lipids)\n- DDE: concentration of DDE (ng/g lipids)\n- Dieldrin: concentration of dieldrin (ng/g lipids)\n- Sample size weight of collected amount of preenoil\n\n2. Morphometric data fulmars\n\n- Fulmar: bird number, corresponds with sheet 'Concentrations fulmars'. \n- Bill Length (mm): length of bill (tip to base)\n- Head Length (mm): length of head (tip of bill to back of head)\n- Tarsus (mm): length of tarsus\n- Wing Length (cm): length of right wing\n- Weight (kg): weight of bird (without bag)\n\n3. 'Concentrations Adelies'\n\nAdelie: bird number, corresponds with sheet 'morphometric data Adelies'.\n- PCB153: concentration of PCB-congener 153 (ng/g lipids)\n- HCB: concentration of hexachlorobenzene (ng/g lipids)\n- DDE: concentration of DDE (ng/g lipids)\n- Dieldrin: concentration of dieldrin (ng/g lipids)\n- Sample size weight of collected amount of preenoil\n\n4. 'Morphometric data Adelies'\n\n- Adelie: bird number, corresponds with sheet 'Concentrations Adelies'. \n- Bill (mm): length of bill (tip to base)\n- Head Length (mm): length of head (tip of bill to back of head)\n- Tarsus (mm): length of tarsus\n- Flipper Length (cm): length of right flipper (wing)\n- Weight (kg): weight of bird (without bag)\n\nIn sheets on concentrations: less than d.l.: concentrations below detection limits.",

        "summary": "The programme Festivethno 2010 completes the mission Ethnoequid conducted in 2004 by Emilie Maj among Yakut and Even herders in the Eveno-Bytanta? region, which differs from other regions of Sakha Republic (Yakutia) by a complementary use of reindeer and horse in accordance with cultural choices and geographical and climate imperatives. Furthermore, Festivethno is an extension of the mission Festivethno 2009 which aimed to study the the Yakut festival of Yhyakh in the city of Yakutsk, as both a national celebration of the Republic and as a neo-shamanic festival for Yakut people, whose economic activity is based on the breeding of horses and cows.\n\nFestivethno 2010 aims to collect ethnographic materials on the spring festival celebrated by one of the minority peoples of the Sakha Republic, the Evens, who still depend largely on reindeer herding, hunting and fisheries.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Eveno-Bytantaj region is that it has been nationalized by the Sakha Republic after the fall of the Soviet Union to protect the cultural heritage, lifestyle and rights of the Even people, who are locally the majority of the population. This region celebrates the festival of Yhyakh in July and, at the end of March, the Even taba byrahann'yka, literally \"the Day of the reindeer herders.\" In this region, the Even festival has a greater social importance than the Yakut one, in its duration, its intensity and the importance of the participation of the population. If, for the inhabitants of central regions of Yakutia, the reindeer herders' festival is an exotic celebration, it is for the Arctic Evens an important time of the year: for herders, it is an opportunity to return to the village, present their work and demonstrate their skills through different types of competitions (reindeer races, jumping on foots, lasso, wrestling ...). Inherited from the Soviet time, the Even festival takes place without the profusion of religious elements that characterize the Yakut Yhyakh.\n\nIn the difficult context of social recompositions in the Postcommunist period, the festival remains a Soviet relic, which highlights the brave figure of the reindeer herder, ignoring the removal of medical aid that had been allocated in the communist period and the increase in the number of suicides and homicides caused by the economic problems and by the significant change in values and lifestyle of Arctic communities that accompanied the collapse of communism.\n\nThe anthropologist will participate in three days of celebration and conduct during the periods preceding and following a fieldwork among people of Even and Yakut nationalities.",
